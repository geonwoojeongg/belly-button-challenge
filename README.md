##Background
In this assignment, you will build an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset Links to an external site., which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.
The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

### Features
On the left is a dropdown menu where you can choose from the id numbers of the participants of the belly button project. Depending on the id you choose, the horizontal bar graph and bubble graph will change to the corresponding id that you select. 

Below the dropdown menu is the profile information of the subject (without names). They also change as you choose which id to look at.
